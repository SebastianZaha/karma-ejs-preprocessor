Preprocesor for .ejs files for karma
====================================

Enables support the underscore.js `.ejs` template system.


Usage
-----

As shown below, add `karma-ejs-preprocessor` to your plugins, add ejs to the preprocessors
directive, and in the `ejsOptions` add a path (absolute) to the location of your templates.

    plugins: [
        'karma-qunit',
        [...]
        'karma-ejs-preprocessor',
    ],
    preprocessors: {
        '**/*.ejs': ['ejs']
    },
    ejsOptions: {
        parentPath: 'app/assets/javascripts/templates/',
        compileOptions: {
            // See https://github.com/tj/ejs#options for more options
            open: '{{',
            close: '}}',

            // An example of passing helper function that the EJS files can use.
            helpMe: function () {
                return 'Help!!';
            }
        }
    },
    [...]

The `parentPath` is relative to the `basePath` specified in your config.

The `JST` global variable will contain keys relative to `parentPath` for your templates. E.g. for
the file `/Users/sebi/devel/super_site/app/assets/javascripts/templates/homepage/header.ejs`, by
specifying the proper `parentPath` you can get the template initialized in `JST['homepage/header']`.
